## Where are the builds??

I'm not releasing any builds yet, because the game is not ready for that, and I don't want to disappoint people with a buggy mess and a lack of gameplay.

I also don't want any more testers, there just isn't enough content to test.

## When will it be released?

With the current speed and budget, probably never :D

School is taking a lot of my time, and I'm not really motivated to work on the game, so I'm not sure when it will be released.

## Will it be another watch out for the monsters or walking simulator game?

Both.

The plans might change, but I'm planning to make 3 modes:

-   Walking simulator - there will be no entities, and you will be able to enjoy some classic liminal spaces (but I will probably fail at that).
-   Backrooms wiki accurate (ignoring the level design) - self explanatory
-   Watch out for the monsters - Loads of entities and jumpscares, a lot of people wanted this mode for some reason.

## Will it be free?

Uhhh, I don't know, I really want to make it free, but I also want to make money from it, so I will probably make it paid, but I don't think it will be expensive.

## Will it be open source?

I don't want to and I can't make the whole game open source (paid assets), but I will probably make the C++ side of things open source, so people can improve my ugly code :)

## Will it work on Linux?

Yes, I'm one of the few game devs that actually care about Linux players (because I'm a Linux user myself), and I will try my best to support Linux.

Unfortunately, Epic is making it really hard to support Linux ([this issue for example](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/nanite-tessellation-in-ue-5-3/1198899/8)), so while I will still try to provide the game builds for Linux, not all features might be available.

Or just use Wine, I won't implement any shitty anti-cheats, so it should work just fine.

I'm also planning to support LinuxArm64 ðŸ˜Ž.

## How's the performance?

Depends on the level, for example, Level 0 runs at 100fps on my GTX 1050 Ti, Level 1 runs at 15fps, and poolrooms run at 50fps.

(and yes, I develop the game on a GTX 1050 Ti :D)
