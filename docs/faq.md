## Where are the builds??

I'm not releasing any builds yet, because the game is not ready for that, and I don't want to disappoint people with a buggy mess and a lack of gameplay.

I also don't want any testers for now, there just isn't enough content to test yet.

## When will it be released?

With the current speed and budget, probably never :D

School is taking a lot of my time, and I'm not really motivated to work on the game.

There is no ETA.

## Will it be another watch out for the monsters or walking simulator game?

Both.

The plans might change, but I'm planning to make the following gamemodes:

-   Liminal experience or something (walking simulator) - I want to achieve the feeling that you are not alone, but I don't want to add any jumpscares or entities, just a creepy atmosphere.
-   A little bit of monsters - For those who won't get the creepy feeling from the previous gamemode.
-   Watch out for the monstersâ„¢ - Loads of entities and jumpscares, recommended for playing with friends :D.

## Price?

Not sure yet, but probably 5-10$. Or even cheaper if no one will buy it :D

## Will it be multiplayer?

Singleplayer will be recommended (especially for the liminal experience), but yes, it will be multiplayer.

And there will be no player limit, because fuck it, I hate games that limit the player count. **Just be aware that it will ruin your experience**

## Will it work on Linux?

Yes, I'm one of the few game devs that actually care about Linux players (because I'm a Linux user myself), and I will try my best to support Linux.

Unfortunately, Epic is making it really hard to support Linux ([~~this issue for example~~](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/nanite-tessellation-in-ue-5-3/1198899/8)) [omg epic "fixed" it](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commit/70fdcc4dfe67ca54fbc7d26ce1ca2feb2df28c5e), so while I will still try to provide the game builds for Linux, not all features might be available.

Or just use Wine, I won't implement any shitty anti-cheats, so it should work just fine.

I'm also planning to support LinuxArm64 ðŸ˜Ž.

## How's the performance?

Depends on the level, for example, Level 0 runs at 100fps on my GTX 1050 Ti, Level 1 runs at 15fps, and poolrooms run at 20fps.

(and yes, I develop the game on a GTX 1050 Ti :D)
